In general the way these services work is that they ask the owner of the IP where they are and have no way to verify it at all. And of course there are always VPN services and proxy servers that will let you choose which country your IP address will read as being in. To say nothing of actually malicious parties that can break into a computer anywhere in the world and then make all of their traffic appear to have come from its IP address. I've also seen the IP address entries for residential ISPs be off by more than a thousand miles simply because the ISP has customers in both places and assigned customers in one place IP addresses listed in the other place. Geo IP can be useful for showing ads as long as you don't care that it's wrong some significant percentage of the time. Thinking it can be used to locate a bad actor is dangerous and absurd.\n",
